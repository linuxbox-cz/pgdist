### Create update

This command creates new file `my_project--1.0.0--1.0.1.sql` in your `sql_dist` folder.  
If `part_count` is specified, PGdist will create specified number of parts with headers and it will put all update-sql in **first part**, it is up to you to divide your sql to parts.  

```
pgdist create-update <git_tag> <new_version> [part_count]

Example:
$ pgdist create-update v1.0.0 1.0.1
load project my_project to test pg
dump structure and data from test pg
load project my_project to test pg
dump structure and data from test pg
Edit created file: sql_dist/my_project--1.0.0--1.0.1.sql
and test it by 'pgdist test-update v1.0.0 1.0.1'
```
