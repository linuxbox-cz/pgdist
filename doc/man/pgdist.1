.SH DESCRIPTION
PGdist is program for PostgreSQL projects management from development to production.

PGdist commands are divided to two sections, develop and management.
.TP
PGdist can:
- manage source files, collaborating with Git

- test project installation in PostgreSQL

- help to create update scripts and test it for mistakes

- display projectâ€˜s diff and existing database structure

- watch for proper role creation in database

- allow dependency settings

- compare data in tables

- make installations and updates on production server (inc. roles, dependencies)

- allow to split install and update scripts to parts, intended to be or not to be done in particular transaction

- show diffs in structured and colored mode
.TP
PGdist requires:
- PostgreSQL

- Git

.SH OPTIONS

.SH DEVELOP CONFIG FILE
Configuration file is located at `~/.pgdist`.
.TP
It looks like this:
[pgdist]
test_db: pgdist@sqltest/postgres

\fBtest_db\fR - PG connection to testing PostgreSQL database.

.SS PGCONN
It defines ssh connection (\fBnot required\fR) + connection URI.

Please use connection URI \fBwithout\fR \fIpostgresql://\fR string.

If you choose to use ssh connection, it is highly recommended to set up \fBssh-key\fR.

See more about connection URI: \fIhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING\fR.
.TP
Examples:
localhost/test_database

postgres@/test_database

localhost//postgres@/
.TP
Below PGCONN will define ssh connection to \fBmy_server\fR with user \fBroot\fR, then open PostgreSQL connection with PG user \fBpostgres\fR, password \fBPASSWORD\fR, PG host \fBlocalhost\fR, listening port \fB5042\fR, database \fBtest_database\fR and connection timeout \fB10 seconds\fR.

root@my_server//postgres:PASSWORD@localhost:5042/test_database?connection_timetout=10

.SH DISTRIBUTION CONFIG FILE
Configuration file is located at `/etc/pgdist.conf`.
.TP
It looks like this:
[pgdist]

installation_path = /usr/share/pgdist/install

password_path = /etc/lbox/postgresql/roles

pguser = postgres

pgdatabase = postgres

pghost = localhost

pgport = 5432

.TP
\fBinstallation_path\fR - path to version/updates scripts
.TP
\fBpassword_path\fR - path to roles passwords
.TP
\fBpguser\fR - default PG user to connect with
.TP
\fBpgdatabase\fR - optional - name of database to connect to
.TP
\fBpghost\fR - optional - PG host
